COVID-19, commonly referred to as Coronavirus, has caused an unprecedented disruption in daily life across the world. Roughly two-million people have been infected with the deadly virus, and over a quarter of all confirmed cases are in the United States. Maintaining consistent, accurate, and thorough data has been, and will remain, vital to governments and individuals as they act to mitigate the spread of the disease. Several sources of data about COVID-19 are freely available online. In this project we utilize public data sets from The New York Times and The COVID Tracking Project, and have built a tool using Spark and Python that enables the end user to conduct basic analysis on this data through the input of YAML configuration files.
